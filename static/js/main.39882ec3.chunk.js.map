through market trends and exploring how different education systems work. Between working on projects and boolin’ with \n                        the Baker’s Dozen at school, I also love to sing, play poker, make tomato sauce, and contemplate Avatar the Last Airbender (iykyk). \n                        </p>\n                        <p>\n                        Amidst all the academic craze and young lunacy, one of my fondest memories from high school was writing my blog.

As an internal engineer, I developed a \n                                crash crawler using Shell and Golang to diagnose Commvault program crashes on client machines. In \n                                addition to this project, I proposed and designed a web application to facilitate how employees reserve \n                                servers, which I’m very happy to say has also been deployed. Outside of my technical work, I also sat \n                                as a chair on the company’s intern committee, where I helped organize networking events, intern trips, \n                                and distributed free food to the best of my ability. \n                                </p>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n                    \n                    <div className = \"section\">\n                        <div className = \"experience yale\"></div>\n                        <div className = \"text\">\n                            <div className  = \"top\">\n                                <div className = \"header\"> Yale University </div>\n                                <div className = \"position\"> Class of 2022 </div>\n                                <div className = \"location\"> New Haven, Connecticut</div>\n                            </div>\n                            <div className = \"body\">\n                                <p>\n                                    I am so proud and lucky to call Yale my home. Since my first day here, I've felt comfortable stepping out \n                                    of what’s familiar, whether it be debating contentious issues in bioethics or \n                                    singing to a crowd of strangers. I sit in breathtaking classes, discuss what excites \n                                    me with others as a TA, and deploy my own projects and software in industry. I’ve met \n                                    people I’d cut off a limb for, travelled for the first time (and 5 times since), and I’ve \n                                    jumped out of a plane. \n                                </p>\n                                <p>\n                                    Yale constantly shows me what I love, exposes me to new way of thinking, and surrounds me with people from \n                                    whom I have the world to learn. boola boola. \n                                </p>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n\n                    <div className = \"section\">\n                        <div className = \"experience princeton\"></div>\n                        <div className = \"text\">\n                            <div className  = \"top\">\n                                <div className = \"header\"> Princeton University</div>\n                                <div className = \"position\"> Research Intern // Software Development</div>\n                                <div className = \"location\"> Tinton Falls, New Jersey </div>\n                            </div>\n                            <div className = \"body\">\n                                <p>\n                                I was a member of Dr. Paul Prucnal’s Lightwave Communications Laboratory under Thomas Lima. Here, in addition \n                                to being assigned an idol’s workstation, I helped develop a virtual lab space to remotely equipment for optical \n                                experiments that are traditionally controlled physically; this involved creating a package in Python to represent \n                                instrument drivers as well as connections made between the instruments within experiments. I also used pyvis to\n                                create a dynamic visualization of the virtual laboratory—showing which instruments and connections are currently \n                                being used—to prevent equipment conflicts. By the end of the internship, we had developed a fully operating virtual \n                                laboratory, allowing research members to conduct their experiments remotely. \n                                </p>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n\n\n                    <div className = \"section\">\n                        <div className = \"experience thorlabs\"></div>\n                        <div className = \"text\">\n                            <div className  = \"top\">\n                                <div className = \"header\"> Thorlabs </div>\n                                <div className = \"position\"> Engineering Intern // Vytran Division </div>\n                                <div className = \"location\"> Marlboro, New Jersey </div>\n                            </div>\n                            <div className = \"body\">\n                                <p>\n                                I was a member of Vytran’s R+D department, where I worked on developing a cleaner and more efficient \n                                optical fiber splicer (a device used to create fiber optic connections). I used Autodesk Inventor to \n                                design components (i.e telescope unit, refractors) of the splicer and Python to create an algorithm that \n                                would help counter laser drift and maintain clean splices. My time in this lab was invaluable — it was \n                                incredibly rewarding to experience the project’s entire life cycle, from conception to its ultimate deployment \n                                in industry. I was also lucky enough to present this project at the Intel Science and Engineering \n                                Fair in LA, where I got the opportunity to meet countless young scientists and lay on a beach in April.\n\n\n                                </p>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                    </div>\n\n                    <div className = \"section\">\n                        <div className = \"experience hths\"></div>\n                        <div className = \"text\">\n                            <div className  = \"top\">\n                                <div className = \"header\"> High Technology High School </div>\n                                <div className = \"position\"> Class of 2018 </div>\n                                <div className = \"location\"> Lincroft, New Jersey </div>\n                            </div>\n                            <div className = \"body\">\n                                <p>\n                                High Tech was a marathon. High school was relentless and difficult, \n                                and at many times left me in doubt of whether my ambitions were worth \n                                the effort; it was also, however, four of the most formative years of \n                                my life. In addition to providing an unparalleled breadth of opportunity, \n                                High Tech challenged me to think independently and to persist through times \n                                when trying seemed endless, and for that I am incredibly grateful. It was here \n                                also that I could be stupid—crabbing at 2a.m. or what went down at PEEC \n                                (iykyk)— alongside some of my closest friends.\n
